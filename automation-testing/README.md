## About Me

Hi! I'm Pavel, a QA engineer based in Tenerife, Spain.  
I transitioned from full-stack development to quality assurance because I enjoy the mix of structure, creativity, and critical thinking that testing requires.  

I focus on delivering high-quality results through both manual precision and practical automation.
